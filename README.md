# Auto white balance

You left auto white balance on while taking your video and ended up with a disastrous effect where the colors change during the video. Also, you do not feel like retaking the video and do not have Adobe Premiere to fix the issue. Then this tool might be for you.

It allows defining a region of the image that should be constant in color and then adjusts the video accordingly.

I have used it for Screenflow. See the video below.
